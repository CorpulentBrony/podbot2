# podbot2

## **_notices your bot_**

## OwO what's this?

`podbot2` is a completely re-written version of[`podbot`](https://github.com/CorpulentBrony/podbot).  It is a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot written in JavaScript to run on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) by leveraging the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) API.

## Why a new repository?

I am completely re-writing all the code from scratch, and rather than try to deal with that mess in an existing repository I decided it'd be easier for my sanity to do this as a brand new one.  Sorry.

## What will it be able to do?

[Derpibooru](https://www.derpibooru.org/) image, [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/) thread, [Google](https://google.com), [Google image](https://images.google.com/), and [YouTube](https://youtube.com) searches, all using their respective APIs.  More documentation to come as more functions are implemented.

## Who is best horse?
